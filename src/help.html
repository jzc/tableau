<h1>tableau</h1>
<p>  
  <strong>TL;DR:</strong> This is an interactive app
  demonstrating <em>tableau proofs</em> for propositional logic.  A
  tableau is essentially a tree of formulae where the formulae
  occuring lower in the tree are logical consequences of the formulae
  above.  The goal of a tableau proof is to find a contradiction in
  every branch of the tree; a contradiction is a pair of formulae form
  $\varphi$ and <span class="nobreak">$\neg \varphi$.</span> <em>Left click</em>
  formulae to simplify them; if there are multiple branches below a
  formula you want to simplify, you will have to left click one of the
  highlighted branches below to the formula to apply the
  simplification to that branch. If you right click a formula, then
  the formulae that share a branch with that formula will be
  highlighted. Then, if you right click one the higlighted formulae
  such that the pair of formulae you right clicked are of the form $\varphi$
  and <span class="nobreak">$\neg \varphi$,</span> then the branches that
  contain the formulae you selected
  be <span class="nobreak"><em>closed</em></span>; a closed branch
  displays an "X" underneath it. To complete a tableau proof, you need
  to close every branch.
