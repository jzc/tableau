<h1>tableau</h1>
<p>  
  <strong>TL;DR:</strong>
  This is an interactive app demonstrating <em>tableau proofs</em>
  for propositional logic.

  Roughly, a tableau is a tree of formulae where the formulae occuring
  lower in the tree are logical consequences of the formulae
  above. The goal of a tableau proof is to find a contradiction in
  every branch of the tree; a contradiction is the formula \bot or a
  pair of formulae of the form p and \not p. 
  
  <em>Left click</em> formulae to
  simplify them; if there are multiple branches below a
  formula you want to simplify, you will have to left
  click one of the highlighted branches below to the formula
  to apply the simplification to that branch.

  If \bot appears in your tableau, right clicking it will
  close all the branches it appears in. Otherwise, if you
  right click a formula other than \bot, then the formulae
  that share a branch with that formula will be highlighted.
  If you right click one the higlighted formulae such that the pair
  of formulae you right clicked are of the form \phi and \not \phi,
  then the branches that contain the formulae you selected be closed.
