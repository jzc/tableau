<h1>tableau</h1>
<p>  
  <strong>TL;DR:</strong>
  This is an interactive app demonstrating <em>tableau proofs</em>
  for propositional logic.
  <em>Left click</em> formulae to
  simplify them; if there are multiple branches below a
  formula you want to simplify, you will have to left
  click one of the highlighted branches below to the formula
  to apply the simplification to that branch. You can only
  simplify a formula in a branch once; if a formula has been
  simplified in every branch, it will be darkened.  

  In a tableau proof, you continually
  build a tree of formulae where every formula is either an
  assumption or is a logical consequence of some formula
  above it.
